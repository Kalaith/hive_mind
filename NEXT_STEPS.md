# Next Steps for Hive Mind

## Top 3 Priority Items

### 1. Collective Intelligence Simulation Engine
- Implement node-to-node communication and information propagation systems
- Add emergent behavior patterns from simple individual node rules
- Create collective decision-making algorithms with consensus mechanisms

### 2. Interactive Network Visualization
- Add real-time network graph visualization with dynamic node connections
- Implement network health monitoring and performance analytics
- Create visual representation of information flow and decision propagation

### 3. Advanced Swarm Mechanics
- Add specialization roles for different node types (workers, scouts, coordinators)
- Implement adaptive network topology that evolves based on environmental pressures
- Create collective learning systems where the network improves over time
